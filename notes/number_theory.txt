- 2 is the only even prime number
- every 2^k -1 is a prime number (Mersenne Prime Numbers)



*prime testing methods*
1. check from to 2 to n-1 if any one of them is a divisor ?  if all fails to be a divisor of n then n is a prime number


2. its enough to check from 2 to sqrt(n) 
		logic behind this comes from divisor theorem where we know that divisors of a number comes in pair 
		for example :
	    	12 = 1 X 12
			 = 2 X 6
			 = 3 X 4
			 = 4 X 3 
			 = 6 X 2
		After sqrt(n) divisors repeats. If we want to get divisors of a number its enough to check till sqrt(n).
		this can be proved mathematically using *contradiction method* 
		let's say n = a x b (taking any two divisors of n )

		if a >sqrt(n) and b > sqrt(n) 
			then a x b 
				= (sqrt(n)+p) x (sqrt(n)+q) 
				= n + p . q + q . sqrt(n) + p . sqrt(n)
				which is greater than n
		else if a < sqrt(n) and b < sqrt(n)
			then a x b
				= (sqrt(n)-p) x (sqrt(n)-q)
				= n + p . q  - q . sqrt(n) - p . sqrt(n)
				which is also not equals to the n only
		therefore
			for every pair of divisors a and b 
			a <=sqrt(n) then b>=sqrt(n)

	now if we come to our prime testing
			we want to check only divisors and its enough to check one divisor from every pair so we itertate 2....sqrt(n)


3. Then till this point we're testing every divisor from 2 to sqrt(n)

if a number is not divisible by 2 
    then it won't be divisible by any even number
alse if the number is not divisible by 3 
    then it won't be divisible by 3's multiple
                                    such as 9,15,21 .... so on
observation : 
    if a number n is not divisible 
        by prime numbers less than n (ultimately sqrt(n)) 
            then no way it will be divisible by other numbers
